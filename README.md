# Data-Exploration-My-First-DataFrame-with-PySpark-

# PySpark Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates a basic PySpark data analysis workflow using a CSV file. The included code reads a CSV file into a PySpark DataFrame and showcases various functionalities, such as displaying data and printing the DataFrame schema.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- PySpark (install with `pip install pyspark`)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the PySpark script:

    ```bash
    python pyspark_data_analysis.py
    ```

## Usage

- Adjust the CSV file path in the script to point to your data.
- Explore different PySpark functionalities and modify the script for your specific use case.

## File Structure

- `pyspark_data_analysis.py`: The main PySpark script.
- `base_de_dados.csv`: Sample CSV data for analysis.
